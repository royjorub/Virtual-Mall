# Virtual-Mall

## A virtual mall social e-commerce platform, made during coding bootcamp - in Python stack

As part of the requirements to graduate [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.com) coding bootcamp, we had to pass a final exam for each stack taught, as well as do a project finale.
This one, Virtual Mall, was made during Python stack month, using Django framework. This group consisted of Ryan Marean, classmate and friend, and myself.
We had 4 days to think up a project idea, design its front-end deisgn, interactibility, back-end logic and database models structure.

### Description:
Virtual Mall is an app that embodies the concept of a curated social shopping experience.
Essentially, the idea is that most of us come accross local merchants and vendors, during travels or in local markets, that sell great products, but that don't have the exposure to be found online easily.
Virtual Mall allows users to host a digital shopping experience, with curated vendors of their choice, in a visually pleasing manner.
This allows the vendors to reach further in an age of online shopping. 
It gives the users, which are the mall owners, the benefit of choosing which style of products and vendors they like to associate with, which is especially great for social media influencers. 
They can change up their mall every once in a while and showcase different selection of local or global merchants.

There are many more interesting features for the concept, but the best way to understand the idea and what it can be used for, is to check out the presetation. Link posted above :thumbsup:

### Workflow:
The work was split pretty evenly.
We had discussed different potential project ideas. Since it was mine that was selected, I lead the conceptual design, starting with drawing out the wireframe.
This meant that I had to consider user experience, flow, and MVP feature list. I also took on the mantle of project manager, making sure to reach deadlines, albeit a small project overall - a deadline is a deadline.
Ryan created much of the backend models and objects. I did a lot of the MVC logic and views. We worked great as a team and pushed out a great presentation level product.
With day 1 devoted to concept design and planning, we both worked very hard to get the rest done in 3 working days. Ultimately we were very happy with what was accomplished. 
We hit all the goals we had hoped for before presentation, and had an extra day to work on polishing.
I am the one presenting in the linked video. Ryan appears a couple times as well, expanding on relevant details.

### Technologies:
Virtual Mall project was made using the Python language and Django framework. These were easy choices for a small view driven project.
Python, being quick to code with, meant that we could use the "tracer" methhodology, easily running the Django server to see what worked and what didn't. 
Being a 4 day project, with no consequences to data loss or entropy, there was no need for a heavier test driven approach. The idea was to create a smooth 4-6 page runthrough.
With this in mind, it was a fantastic experience working with something as smooth, quick, and easy to change on the fly as python.
Django too is an easy framework to work with. There was no need to deploy the project to the web at first, just to present from a local server during a Zoom meeting, so there really was no need for something more complex.
It is structured, easy to work with. It handles static files comfortably, which was important for this perticular presentation, in which we created premade image backgrounds for the pages.
Most importantly for us, Django can be used with VS code which has a live share feature. 
It meant we could work on problems together, simultanously on the same file, when one of us hit a wall and neeeded another set of eyes.
Everything was done using GitHub for version control, which was invaluable, since we were each working from home.

### Final Thoughts:
Given the scope of the project and what it needed to be for the presentation, I believe we handled it correctly and structured it according to specs.
With that being said, if it were to become anything bigger, that handles actual monetary transaction and user information, as well as a hefty database, there would need to be a completely different approach.
It is understandble that the intricacy of the demands and robustness of the project would require higher integration of technologies, softwares, hardwares and structural architecture. 
The main benefits we have received as students in the art of programming howvever, was the main focus for us. 
Being our first actual project, from thought to paper to coding to presentation of working prototype, the experience was invaluable. Comradere and friendship, as well as education and vocational success, were all strengthened.
Hopefully, folowing projects will be as smooth :sweat_smile:
